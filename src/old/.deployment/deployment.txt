Deployment schedule:
1. Create a development branch on LOCAL machine
	a. Add and commit the changes through Git.
	b. Push changes from dev branch to GitHub
	c. If changes are approved, merge dev branch on GitHub to master branch
2. Fetch changes from GitHub and merge with LOCAL master branch
	a. $ git fetch remotename (# Fetches updates made to a remote repository)
	b. $ git merge remotename/branchname (# Merges updates made online with your local work)
	c. A shortcut to complete steps a. and b. is to conduct a git pull request ($ git pull remotename branchname [# Grabs online updates and merges them with your local work])
3. At this point, the changes are ready to be pushed to the live site.
	a. Use git push remotename to push changes from the LOCAL machine to the SERVER
